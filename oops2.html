We have a sequence of&nbsp;<em>pre-primary&gt;&gt;primary&gt;&gt;secondary&gt;&gt; tertiary.</em> This sequential viewpoint works if we are talking about maybe Nigeria as a country alone. However, if this is about continents and regions, you&rsquo;d have to think about thousands of countries&apos; educational systems all over the world. Mapping out a sequence of actions for each country may get unsustainable, regardless, you&rsquo;d have to start thinking about patterns for all continents.</p>
                                                            <p>This ideology works hand in hand with codes, more data warrants more steps and more functionalities.</p>
                                                            <p>In short, Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a collection of objects(data) and patterns of their interactions. OOP focuses on the thinking process, implementation of what the developer wants to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Code scalability, efficiency, reusability, information protection, easy debugging are all benefits of OOP.</p>

We&rsquo;ve created the&nbsp;<em>Cancer Class</em> with some attributes and methods as well as the&nbsp;<em>BreastCancer</em> Child Class with its. However, if we simply can change the properties of the&nbsp;<em>Cancer class</em> just by the reference of the object, then the attributes lose the information by which it was initially initialized.</p>
                                                            <p>Let&rsquo;s say we have initially created a&nbsp;<em>Cancer class</em> with a&nbsp;<em>black color</em> attribute. Any user with the instance of the object of the&nbsp;<em>BreastCancer</em> can change this color to orange or blue by simply referring to the attribute. To avoid this, we enclosed the attributes in the&nbsp;<strong>getters</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>setters</strong> method. We can see from the&nbsp;<strong>output</strong> snippet that each of the classes retained its attributes.</p>
                                                            <p><strong>super</strong>() seen under the child class function helps to specifically call the Parent class method which has been overridden in the child class, from the child class. In case you need to call a method or attribute from a specific parent class, use&nbsp;<em>super()</em>.</p>

They are used for private variables. According to Python documentation &minus; If your class is intended to have child classes, and there are attributes you don&rsquo;t want the child classes to use, consider naming them with double leading and not more than one trailing underscore.</p>
                                                            <p>Python interpreter rewrites the attribute name to avoid naming conflicts in child classes and changes the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to create collisions when the class is extended later.</p>

Child class&nbsp;<strong>Puppy</strong> can make sounds as well but a less loud one. Significantly, the method inherited from the parent class wouldn&rsquo;t fit in the child class, so a different implementation is provided for the child class.</p>
                                                            <p>Meanwhile, each of the methods is called based on the type of object used in calling it. When&nbsp;<em>Puppy</em> class object&nbsp;<strong>py</strong> is used to call an overridden method&nbsp;<em>bark()</em> then the&nbsp;<em>Puppy</em> class version of the method&nbsp;<strong>HOWL</strong> is printed. But if the&nbsp;<em>Dog</em> class object&nbsp;<strong>dg</strong> with the method&nbsp;<em>bark()</em> is called,&nbsp;<strong>WOOF</strong> is printed out.</p>

                                                            <p>Method or function may have the same name, but a different number of parameters passed into the method. Different outputs are going to be gotten depending on the number of parameters passed in.</p>

                                                            <p>Regardless, true method overloading is utilized in other programming languages and not seemingly Python.</p>

A&nbsp;<em>car</em> is not seen as different individual parts but a well-defined object with its distinct behaviors. Abstraction in OOP is achieved by using abstract classes and methods.</p>
