  <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way from being a segment of science fiction to reality. And because AI has turned into a mainstream technology in the present industry and is now a part of the common man’s everyday life, there is a new debate that has sparked – Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence.</p>

<p>While AI looks to design and generate intelligent machines that can do human-like tasks, we cannot help but wonder, “Is Artificial Intelligence sufficient in itself?”</p>

<p>Our biggest fear, perhaps is that AI will “replace” humans at all levels and also outsmart them in a soon. </p>
<h1>What Is Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>AI is a branch of data science that specializes in creating smart machines that are capable of executing a broad range of tasks that typically need human intelligence and reasoning capabilities.</p>

<h1>What Is Human Intelligence</h1>
<p>Human Intelligence is a humans’ intellectual ability that enables us to learn from various experiences, think, understand intricate concepts, apply reasoning and logic, solve mathematical problems, identify patterns, make decisions, hold on to information, communicate with fellow human beings, and so on.</p>

<h1>Artificial Intelligence Vs. Human Intelligence: A Comparison</h1><p>
Nature: While Human Intelligence looks to adjust to new environments by using a combination of various cognitive processes, AI aims to create machines that can imitate human behavior and perform human-like actions. Machines are digital, but the human brain is analogous.</p>
Functioning: Humans use the brain’s memory, computing power and ability to think, while AI-powered machines depend on data and instructions fed into the system.</p>
<p>Learning Power: Human Intelligence is all about learning and understanding from different incidents and past experiences. However, AI falls behind in this area, as AI cannot think.
What Brian Cells Be Tweaked To Learn Faster?</p>
<p>The decision-making control or power of AI systems depends on the data they are trained on, and how they are connected to a specific event. AI machines can never understand the concept of “cause and effect” as they do not possess any sense.</p>

<p>Humans hold the exclusive ability to learn, understand, and then apply their acquired knowledge in combination with reasoning and logic, and understanding. </p>

<h1>Differences In Brain Cells Could Be The Reason For Learning Differences Between AI And Humans </h1>
<p>A new study has found that by tweaking the electrical properties of specific cells in brain networks simulations, the networks learned faster than simulations with matching cells. They also found that the networks required lesser of the tweaked cells to attain the same results, and that the method is less energy-intensive than models with identical cells.</p>

<p>These findings explain why our brains are so good at learning and may also enable us to create better AI systems, such as digital assistants that can identify and recognize faces and voices or also self-driving car technologies.</p>

<p>To carry out the study, the researchers concentrated on tweaking the “time constant” –how rapidly each cell chooses what it wants to do depending on what the cells connected to it are doing. Some cells will decide very quickly, whereas other cells are slower to react, founding their decision on what other cells have been doing.</p>

<h1>Artificial Intelligence Vs. Human Intelligence: What Will The Future Hold</h1>
<p>As of now, AI is evolving all the time. The time needed to train AI systems is quite high, which is not possible without human interference. Be it autonomous robots and cars, or sophisticated technologies, such as natural language processing and image processing – all depend on human intelligence.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As scientists and researchers still do not know what makes the human thought process so special, it is not likely that machines that can think like humans will be made any time soon. The future of AI will for now be mainly controlled by human abilities. It will be complemented by cognizance and human intelligence.</p>
