  <h1>Baby X, The Intelligent Toddler Simulation, Is Getting Smarter Every Day</h1>
  <p> New Zealand-based researchers have taught a computer-generated baby how to make faces, read, and speak&mdash; could the robot apocalypse really be this adorable? Holding a children's picture book up to his computer screen, a researcher for the Auckland Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies in New Zealand coos and croons into the microphone and webcam. On the other side of the screen, a blonde toddler mimics his facial expressions, reads simple words aloud, and even plays basic video games with the scientist. Known only as Baby X, this 3D-simulated human child is getting smarter every day. An experiment in machine learning, Baby X is a program that imitates the biological processes of learning, including association, conditioning and reinforcement learning. By algorithmically simulating the chemical reactions of the human brain&mdash; think dopamine release or increased oxytocin levels&mdash; and connecting them with sensory digital input, when Baby X learns to imitate a facial expression, for instance, software developers write protocols for the variable time intervals between action and response. Effectively &quot;teaching&quot; the child through code, while engineering such a program is no cakewalk, the result is an adorably giggling digital baby with an uncanny ability to learn through interaction.</p>

<p>The latest experiments from the Laboratory for Animate Technologies highlight Baby X's ability to read simple words aloud and identify objects that correlate to those same words. A far cry from the kind of self-improving, self-replicating programs we all know and love to fear, Baby X soars beyond the Uncanny Valley, looking adorably confused when it doesn't understand signals, and utterly joyful when its responses are correct. It almost brings a tear to our eye to watch Baby X grow up so fast&mdash; we just hope that when the Singularity comes, Baby X remembers us for the good times.</p>

Baby X responds to stimuli provided by a researcher for the Auckland Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies. Baby X is even able to recognize faces.

<p>The Laboratory for Animate Technologies is developing a whole series of biologically-inspired simulations of neural networks, biomechanical facial expressions, and brain language. Read more about their research on their website.</p>
