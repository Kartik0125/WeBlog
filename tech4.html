<h1>Top 18 Low-Code and No-Code ML Platforms</h1>
Machine learning becomes more accessible to companies and individuals when there is less coding involved. If you are just starting your path in ML, feel free to check out these low-code and no-code platforms.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between low-code and no-code?</h3><p>
You have probably heard the terms &lsquo;low-code&rsquo; and &lsquo;no-code&rsquo; before.</p>

<p>Low-code simply stands for a reduced amount of coding. A lot of elements can be simply dragged and dropped from the library. However, it is also possible to customize them by writing your own code, which gives increased flexibility.</p>

<h3>1lt69pid.1_(47).jpg</h3><p>
No-code platforms require no knowledge of programming at all. They can be used by different people like artists, teachers, top managers. They need AI in their work but don&rsquo;t want to dive deep into programming and computer science. No-code solutions are quite limited in functionality but allow you to build something simple quickly.</p>

<p>In practice, the border between no-code and low-code platforms is pretty thin. Platforms that promote themselves as &lsquo;no-code&rsquo; still usually leave some space for customization.</p>
