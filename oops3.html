                                                                    </div>

                                                                </div>
                                                                <div><br></div>
                                                                <div>
                                                                    <p>In object-oriented programming, your program will be split into several small, manageable, reusable programs. Each small program has it&rsquo;s own identity, data, logic and how it&rsquo;s going to communicate with the rest of the other small programs.</p>
                                                                    <h1>Objects</h1>
                                                                    <p>When you think about Objects, you should think about the real world situations. Object-Orientation was intended to be closer to the real world, hence, make it easier and more realistic.</p>
                                                                    <h2>What are the Objects?, Well, Objects could be:</h2>
                                                                    <ul>
                                                                        <li>Something visible for you, like the&nbsp;<em>car</em>,&nbsp;<em>phone</em>,&nbsp;<em>apple</em>,&nbsp;<em>duck</em>,&nbsp;<em>lamp</em>.</li>
                                                                        <li>Something that you can&rsquo;t touch, like the&nbsp;<em>Time</em>,&nbsp;<em>Event</em>,&nbsp;<em>Account</em>.</li>
                                                                    </ul>
                                                                    <figure>
                                                                        <div><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*0ttFuc9a8RMCQxCbrNeMNg.png" width="600" height="450"></div>
                                                                        <figcaption>Objects</figcaption>
                                                                    </figure>
                                                                    <p>Each Objects has it&rsquo;s own&nbsp;<em>attributes</em>, and behavior. Objects are separate from one another. They have their own existence, their own identity that is independent of other objects.</p>
                                                                    <h2>What do we mean by attributes?</h2>
                                                                    <p>It&rsquo;s the characteristics or the properties of the Object, like for example, in case of a&nbsp;<em>duck</em>, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>weight&nbsp;</em>&amp;&nbsp;<em>color.&nbsp;</em>They describe the current state of an object. The state of one object is independent of another. Maybe you will have a&nbsp;<em>duck</em> that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>white</em> and another one is&nbsp;<em>black</em>.</p>
                                                                    <h2>What do I mean by behavior?</h2>
                                                                    <p>Behavior is things that the Object can do, in case of&nbsp;<em>duck</em>, It can&nbsp;<em>fly</em>. Another example, in case of&nbsp;<em>Account</em>, we can&nbsp;<em>deposit</em> or/and&nbsp;<em>withdraw</em> from any&nbsp;<em>account</em>. Again, Each account is totally independent on the other. We may&nbsp;<em>deposit</em> from an account and&nbsp;<em>withdraw</em> from another account.</p>
                                                                    <p>Another thing you have to notice before leaving Objects part is, Objects are&nbsp;<em>nouns</em>, they aren&rsquo;t behaviors nor properties. You should differentiate of what&rsquo;s actually an Object and what&rsquo;s a behavior, and a property.</p>
                                                                    <h2>Now, the questions is, How do we construct these objects in our program?</h2>
                                                                    <p>Well, They don&rsquo;t magically appear in our program, and to do that, there is another word we must explore that goes hand in hand with object, and that word is&nbsp;<strong>Class</strong>.</p>
                                                                    <h1>Class</h1>
                                                                    <p>When you start talking about Objects, you have to mention Classes.</p>
                                                                    <h2>So, What is a class?</h2>
                                                                    <p>Well, a class is the place where you can identify the behaviors and properties of an Object. So,<em>&nbsp;</em>the properties and behavior of an Object, will be defined inside a class.</p>
                                                                    <figure>
                                                                        <div><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/350/1*NuDQDl5fBnKxaR0proeDmg.png" width="350" height="187"></div>
                                                                        <figcaption>Bank Account Class</figcaption>
                                                                    </figure>
                                                                    <p>So, a class is a&nbsp;<em>blueprint</em>, it provides the definition for an Object, the definition says what are the properties and the behaviors of the Object. Let&rsquo;s take an example, When you build a&nbsp;<em>house</em>, you start making the&nbsp;<em>blueprint</em>, in other words you start defining it&rsquo;s properties and behaviors, and then, you use this&nbsp;<em>blueprint</em> to build different&nbsp;<em>houses</em>, or more formally, different objects from the same&nbsp;<em>blueprint</em>.</p>
                                                                    <p>So, Objects from the same&nbsp;<em>blueprint</em>, or more formally the same class, share the same properties and behaviors. However, even they share the same Class, each Object instantiated from this Class is independent on the other.</p>
                                                                    <p>It&rsquo;s enough for Objects and Classes, Let&rsquo;s move on to other important concepts in OOP.</p>
                                                                    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
                                                                    <p>Abstraction means you start focusing on the common properties and behaviors of some Objects, and we automatically will discard what&rsquo;s unimportant or irrelevant.</p>
                                                                    <h2>What came into your mind when I say &ldquo;Car&rdquo;?</h2>
                                                                    <p>If we say Car, we didn&rsquo;t explicitly say if the car is BMW or Audi, if it&rsquo;s red or black, if it&rsquo;s small or large. Your mental model of a car might have a color and size, but, it&rsquo;s unlikely to have a smell or a flavor because those things are irrelevant to the idea of a car.</p>
                                                                    <figure>
                                                                        <div><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/582/1*1WYfFLaqGbnZIWQjrzfaHw.jpeg" width="582" height="329"></div>
                                                                        <figcaption>Cars</figcaption>
                                                                    </figure>

                                                                    <blockquote>

But, we don&rsquo;t create a class for each brand, instead, we will abstract; focus on the common essential qualities of the idea, and we will write&nbsp;<strong>one&nbsp;</strong>class called Car.</p>
                                                                        <p>And As a way to discard what&rsquo;s unimportant, we should focus on how the class should look like for this application under these circumstances at this time. In Other words, you care only about the information that you need in this situation.</p>
                                                                    </blockquote>

In this case, you will have to do of what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;<em>Inheritance</em>&rdquo;, and we will get into it later.</p>
                                                                    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>

Encapsulation implies the idea of breaking down our program into small mini-programs; classes, where each class has a set of related attributes and behaviors.</p>
                                                                    <p>Encapsulation also implies the idea of hiding the content of a Class, unless it&rsquo;s necessary to expose. We need to restrict the access to our class as much as we can, so that we can change the properties and the behaviors only from inside the class.</p>
                                                                    <figure>

Then, restrict access to the inner works of that class by hiding the attributes and methods so that they&rsquo;re only accessible from inside the class scope.</p>
                                                                    <h2>What&rsquo;s the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction?</h2>

                                                                    <p>Abstraction is a more generic term, and it&rsquo;s often not possible without hiding the object&rsquo;s class content by encapsulation; if a class exposes its internal content, thus, it cannot be abstracted.</p>
                                                                    <h2>Why should we hide attributes and methods of an object?</h2>
